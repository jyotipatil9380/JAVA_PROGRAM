Given two strings txt and pat, return the 0-based index of the first occurrence of the substring pat in txt. If pat is not found, return -1.
Note: You are not allowed to use the inbuilt function.

Examples :

Input: txt = "GeeksForGeeks", pat = "Fr"
Output: -1
Explanation: "Fr" is not present in the string "GeeksForGeeks" as substring.
Input: txt = "GeeksForGeeks", pat = "For"
Output: 5
Explanation: "For" is present as substring in "GeeksForGeeks" from index 5 (0 based indexing).
Input: txt = "GeeksForGeeks", pat = "gr"
Output: -1
Explanation: "gr" is not present in the string "GeeksForGeeks" as substring.

class Solution {
    int firstOccurence(String txt, String pat) {
        // code here
        for(int i=0;i<txt.length();i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<pat.length();j++)
            {
                if(txt.contains(pat))
                {
                    return txt.indexOf(pat);
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
